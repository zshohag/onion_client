Banner Component: Calls handleSearch whenever the input value changes, triggering a refetch of the food data.
Home Component: Uses a useEffect hook to automatically update the menuTab state based on the search query results.
Foods Component: Filters the food items based on the selected menuTab and displays them accordingly.
This setup ensures that the food type is automatically selected based on the search query, and the relevant food items are displayed.
